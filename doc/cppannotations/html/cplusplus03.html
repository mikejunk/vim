<p>
In this chapter <strong>C++</strong> is further explored. The possibility to
declare functions in <code>struct</code>s is illustrated in various examples; the
concept of a <code>class</code> is introduced; casting is covered in detail; many new
types are introduced and several important notational extensions to <strong>C</strong> are
discussed.
<p>
<a name="l27"></a>
<h2>3.1: Extensions to C</h2>
Before we continue with the `real' object-approach to programming, we first
introduce some extensions to the <strong>C</strong> programming language: not mere
differences between <strong>C</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>, but syntactic constructs and keywords
not found in <strong>C</strong>.
<p>
<a name="INTRONAME"></a><a name="l28"></a>
<h3>3.1.1: Namespaces</h3>
    <strong>C++</strong> introduces the notion of a <a name="an118"></a><em>namespace</em>: all symbols are defined
in a larger context, called a <em>namespace</em>. Namespaces are used to avoid
    <a name="an119"></a>name conflicts that could arise when a programmer would like to define
a function like <code>sin</code> operating on <em>degrees</em>, but does not want to lose
the capability of using the standard <code>sin</code> function, operating on
<em>radians</em>.
<p>
Namespaces are covered extensively in chapter <a href="cplusplus04.html#NAMESPACE">4</a>. For now it
should be noted that most compilers require the explicit declaration of a
<a name="an120"></a><em>standard namespace</em>: <code>std</code>. So, unless otherwise indicated, it is
stressed that all examples in the Annotations now implicitly use the
    <a name="an121"></a>
        <pre>
        using namespace std;
</pre>
    declaration. So, if you actually intend to compile examples given in
the <strong>C++</strong> Annotations, make sure that the sources start with the above <code>using</code>
declaration.
<p>
<a name="l29"></a>
<h3>3.1.2: The scope resolution operator ::</h3>
    <strong>C++</strong> introduces several new operators, among which the
<a name="an122"></a>scope resolution operator (<a name="an123"></a><code>::</code>). This operator can be
used in situations where a global variable exists having the same name as a
local variable:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int counter = 50;                   // global variable

    int main()
    {
        for (int counter = 1;           // this refers to the
             counter &lt; 10;              // local variable
             counter++)
        {
            printf("%d\n",
                    ::counter           // global variable
                    /                   // divided by
                    counter);           // local variable
        }
    }
</pre>
    In the above program the scope operator is used to address a global
variable instead of the local variable having the same name. In <strong>C++</strong> the
scope operator is used extensively, but it is seldom used to reach a global
variable shadowed by an identically named local variable. Its main purpose
is described in chapter <a href="cplusplus07.html#Classes">7</a>.
<p>
<a name="ConstRule"></a><a name="l30"></a>
<h3>3.1.3: Using the keyword `const'</h3>
    Even though the keyword <a name="an124"></a><code>const</code> is part of the <strong>C</strong> grammar, its use is
more important and much more common in <strong>C++</strong> than it is in <strong>C</strong>.
<p>
The <code>const</code> keyword is a modifier stating that the value of a variable
or of an argument may not be modified. In the following example the intent is
to  change the value of a variable <code>ival</code>, which fails:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        int const ival = 3;     // a constant int
                                // initialized to 3

        ival = 4;               // assignment produces
                                // an error message
    }
</pre>
    This example shows how <code>ival</code> may be initialized to a given value in its
definition; attempts to change the value later (in an assignment) are not
permitted.
<p>
Variables that are declared <code>const</code> can, in contrast to <strong>C</strong>, be used to
specify the size of an array, as in the following example:
        <pre>
    int const size = 20;
    char buf[size];             // 20 chars big
</pre>
    Another use of the keyword <code>const</code> is seen in the declaration of
pointers, e.g., in pointer-arguments. In the declaration
        <pre>
    char const *buf;
</pre>
    <code>buf</code> is a pointer variable pointing to <code>char</code>s. Whatever is pointed
to by <code>buf</code> may not be changed through <code>buf</code>: the <code>char</code>s are declared
as <code>const</code>. The pointer <code>buf</code> itself however may be changed. A statement
like <code>*buf = 'a';</code> is therefore not allowed, while <code>++buf</code> is.
<p>
In the declaration
        <pre>
    char *const buf;
</pre>
    <code>buf</code> itself is a <code>const</code> pointer which may not be changed. Whatever
<code>char</code>s are pointed to by <code>buf</code> may be changed at will.
<p>
Finally, the declaration
        <pre>
    char const *const buf;
</pre>
    is also possible; here, neither the pointer nor what it points to may be
changed.
<p>
The <a name="an125"></a>rule of thumb for the placement of the keyword <code>const</code> is the
following: whatever occurs to the <em>left</em> to the keyword may not be changed.
<p>
Although simple, this rule of thumb is often used. For example,
    <a name="an126"></a>
    Bjarne Stroustrup states (in
    <a name="an127"></a>
    <a target=_top href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#constplacement">http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq2.html#constplacement</a>):
    <blockquote>
    <em>Should I put "const" before or after the type?</em>
<p>
<em>I put it before, but that's a matter of taste. "const T" and "T const"
were always (both) allowed and equivalent. For example:</em>
        <pre>
    const int a = 1;        // OK
    int const b = 2;        // also OK
</pre>
    <em>My guess is that using the first version will confuse fewer programmers
(``is more idiomatic'').</em>
    </blockquote>
    But we've already seen an example where applying this simple `before'
placement rule for the keyword <code>const</code> produces unexpected (i.e., unwanted)
results as we will shortly see (below). Furthermore, the `idiomatic'
before-placement also conflicts with the notion of <a name="an128"></a><em>const functions</em>, which
we will encounter in section <a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a>. With const functions the
keyword <code>const</code> is also placed behind rather than before the name of the
function.
<p>
The definition or declaration (either or not containing <code>const</code>) should
always be read from the variable or function identifier back to the type
indentifier:
        <blockquote>
    ``Buf is a const pointer to const characters''
        </blockquote>
    This rule of thumb is especially useful in cases where confusion may
occur.  In examples of <strong>C++</strong> code published in other places one often
encounters the reverse: <code>const</code> <em>preceding</em> what should not be
altered. That this may result in sloppy code is indicated by our second
example above:
        <pre>
    char const *buf;
</pre>
    What must remain constant here? According to the sloppy interpretation,
the pointer cannot be altered (as <code>const</code> precedes the pointer). In fact,
the char values are the constant entities here, as becomes clear when we try
to compile the following program:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        char const *buf = "hello";

        ++buf;                  // accepted by the compiler
        *buf = 'u';             // rejected by the compiler
    }
</pre>
    Compilation fails on the statement <code>*buf = 'u';</code> and <em>not</em> on the
statement <code>++buf</code>.
<p>
<a name="an129"></a>
    <a name="an130"></a>
    <a name="an131"></a>Marshall Cline's
    <a target=_top href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/const-correctness.html">C++ FAQ</a> gives the
same rule (paragraph 18.5) , in a similar context:
    <blockquote><em>
    [18.5] What's the difference between "const Fred* p", "Fred* const p" and
"const Fred* const p"?</em>
<p>
<em>You have to read pointer declarations right-to-left.</em>
    </blockquote>
    Marshal Cline's advice can be improved, though. Here's a recipe that will
effortlessly dissect even the most complex declaration:
    <ol>
    <li> start reading at the variable's name
    <li> read as far as possible until you reach the end of the declaration or
an (as yet unmatched) closing parenthesis.
    <li> return to the point where you started reading, and read backwards
until you reach the beginning of the declaration or a matching opening
parenthesis.
    <li> If you reached an opening parenthese, continue at step 2 beyond the
parenthesis where you previously stopped.
    </ol>
    Let's apply this recipe to the following (by itself irrelevant) complex
declaration. Little arrows indicate how far we should read at each step and
the direction of the arrow indicates the reading direction:
            <pre>
    char const *(* const (*(*ip)())[])[]

                             ip          Start at the variable's name:
                                             'ip' is

                             ip)         Hitting a closing paren: revert
                             --&gt;

                           (*ip)         Find the matching open paren:
                           &lt;-                'a pointer to'

                           (*ip)())      The next unmatched closing par:
                                --&gt;          'a function (not expecting
                                              arguments)'

                         (*(*ip)())      Find the matching open paren:
                         &lt;-                  'returning a pointer to'

                         (*(*ip)())[])   The next closing par:
                                   --&gt;       'an array of'

                (* const (*(*ip)())[])   Find the matching open paren:
                &lt;--------                    'const pointers to'

                (* const (*(*ip)())[])[] Read until the end:
                                      -&gt;     'an array of'

    char const *(* const (*(*ip)())[])[] Read backwards what's left:
    &lt;-----------                             'pointers to const chars'
</pre>
    Collecting all the parts, we get for <code>char const *(* const
(*(*ip)())[])[]</code>: <em>ip is a pointer to a function (not expecting arguments),
returning a pointer to an array of const pointers to an array of pointers to
const chars</em>. This is what <code>ip</code> represents; the recipe can be used to parse
any declaration you ever encounter.

<h3>3.1.4: `cout', `cin', and `cerr'</h3>
    Analogous to <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong> defines standard input- and output streams
which are available when a program is executed. The streams are:
    <ul>
    <li> <a name="an132"></a><code>cout</code>, analogous to <a name="an133"></a><code>stdout</code>,
    <li> <a name="an134"></a><code>cin</code>, analogous to <a name="an135"></a><code>stdin</code>,
    <li> <a name="an136"></a><code>cerr</code>, analogous to <a name="an137"></a><code>stderr</code>.
    </ul>
    Syntactically these streams are not used as functions: instead, data are
written to streams or read from them using the operators &lt;&lt;, called
the <a name="an138"></a><em>insertion operator</em> and &gt;&gt;, called the
<a name="an139"></a><em>extraction operator</em>.  This is illustrated in the next example:
        <pre>
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        int     ival;
        char    sval[30];

        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number:\n";
        cin &gt;&gt; ival;
        cout &lt;&lt; "And now a string:\n";
        cin &gt;&gt; sval;

        cout &lt;&lt; "The number is: " &lt;&lt; ival &lt;&lt; "\n"
                "And the string is: " &lt;&lt; sval &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    This program reads a number and a string from the <code>cin</code> stream (usually
the keyboard) and prints these data to <code>cout</code>. With respect to streams,
please note:
    <ul>
    <li> The standard streams are declared in the header file
        <a name="an140"></a><code>iostream</code>. In the examples in the
<strong>C++</strong> Annotations this header file is often not mentioned explicitly. Nonetheless,
it <em>must</em> be included (either directly or indirectly) when these streams are
used. Comparable to the use of the <code>using namespace std;</code> clause, the reader
is expected to <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> with all the examples in which the
standard streams are used.
    <li> The streams <code>cout</code>, <code>cin</code> and <code>cerr</code> are variables of so-called
<a name="an141"></a><em>class</em>-types. Such variables are commonly called <em>objects</em>. Classes
are discussed in detail in chapter <a href="cplusplus07.html#Classes">7</a> and are used extensively in
<strong>C++</strong>.
    <li> The stream <code>cin</code> extracts data from a stream and copies the
extracted information to variables (e.g., <code>ival</code> in the above example) using
the extraction operator (two consecutive <code>&gt;</code> characters: &gt;&gt;). Later in
the Annotations we will describe how operators in <strong>C++</strong> can perform quite
different actions than what they are defined to do by the language, as is the
case here. Function overloading has already been mentioned.  In <strong>C++</strong>
<em>operators</em> can also have multiple definitions, which is called <em>operator
overloading</em>.
    <li> The operators which manipulate <code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code> and <code>cerr</code> (i.e.,
&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;) also manipulate variables of different types. In the
above example <code>cout</code> &lt;&lt; <code>ival</code> results in the printing of an integer
value, whereas <code>cout</code> &lt;&lt; <code>"Enter a number"</code> results in the printing
of a string. The actions of the operators therefore depend on the types of
supplied variables.
    <li> The <a name="an142"></a><em>extraction operator</em> (&gt;&gt;) performs a so called
        <a name="an143"></a><em>type safe</em> assignment to a variable by `extracting' its value from
a text stream. Normally, the extraction operator skips all
        <a name="an144"></a><em>white space</em> <a name="an145"></a> characters preceding
the values to be extracted.
    <li> Special <a name="an146"></a>symbolic constants are used for special
situations. Normally a line is terminated by inserting <code>"\n"</code> or
<code>'\n'</code>. But when inserting the <a name="an147"></a><code>endl</code> symbol the line is terminated
followed by the flushing of the stream's internal buffer. Thus, <code>endl</code> can
usually be avoided in favor of <code>'\n'</code> resulting in somewhat more efficient
code.
    </ul>
    The stream objects <code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code> and <code>cerr</code> are not part of the
<strong>C++</strong> grammar proper. The streams are part of the definitions in the header
file <code>iostream</code>. This is comparable to functions like <code>printf</code> that are
not part of the <strong>C</strong> grammar, but were originally written by people who
considered such functions important and collected them in a run-time library.
<p>
A program may still use the old-style functions like <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>
rather than the new-style streams.  The two styles can even be mixed. But
streams offer several clear advantages and in many <strong>C++</strong> programs have
completely replaced the old-style <strong>C</strong> functions. Some advantages of using
streams are:
    <ul>
    <li> Using insertion and extraction operators is
<a name="an148"></a><em>type-safe</em>.  The format strings which are used with <code>printf</code> and
<code>scanf</code> can define wrong format specifiers for their arguments, for which
the compiler sometimes can't warn. In contrast, argument checking with
<code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code> and <code>cerr</code> is performed by the compiler. Consequently it
isn't possible to err by providing an <code>int</code> argument in places where,
according to the format string, a string argument should appear. With streams
there are no format strings.
    <li> The functions <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> (and other functions using
format strings) in fact implement a <em>mini-language</em> which is interpreted at
run-time. In contrast, with streams the <strong>C++</strong> compiler knows exactly which
in- or output action to perform given the arguments used. No mini-language
here.
    <li> In addition the possibilities of the insertion and extraction
operators may be <em>extended</em> allowing objects of classes that didn't exist
when the streams were originally designed to be inserted into or extracted
from streams. Mini languages as used with <code>printf</code> cannot be extended.
    <li> The usage of the left-shift and right-shift operators in the context
of the streams illustrates yet another capability of <strong>C++</strong>: operator
overloading allowing us to redefine the actions an operator performs in
certain contexts. Ascending from <strong>C</strong> operator overloading requires some
getting used, but after a short little while these overloaded operators feel
rather comfortable.
    <li> Streams are independent of the media they operate upon. This (at this
point somewhat abstract) notion means that the same code can be used without
<em>any</em> modification at all to interface your code to <em>any</em> kind of
device. The code using streams can be used when the device is a file on disk;
an Internet connection; a digital camera; a DVD device; a satellite link; and
much more: you name it. Streams allow your code to be decoupled (independent)
of the devices your code is supposed to operate on, which eases maintenance
and allows reuse of the same code in new situations.
    </ul>
    The <em>iostream library</em> has a lot more to offer than just <code>cin, cout</code>
and <code>cerr</code>. In chapter <a href="cplusplus06.html#IOStreams">6</a> <em>iostreams</em> are covered in
greater detail. Even though <a name="an149"></a><code>printf</code> and friends can still be used in
<strong>C++</strong> programs, streams have practically replaced the old-style <strong>C</strong>
<code>I/O</code> functions like <code>printf</code>. If you <em>think</em> you still need to use
<code>printf</code> and related functions, think again: in that case you've probably
not yet completely grasped the possibilities of stream objects.
<p>
<a name="FunctionsInStructs"></a><a name="l32"></a>
<h2>3.2: Functions as part of structs</h2>
Earlier it was mentioned that functions can be part of <code>struct</code>s (see
section <a href="cplusplus02.html#FunctionInStruct">2.5.13</a>).  Such functions are called
    <a name="an150"></a><em>member functions</em>.
This section briefly discusses how to define such functions.
<p>
The code fragment below shows a <code>struct</code> having data fields for a person's
name and address. A function <code>print</code> is included in the
<code>struct</code>'s definition:
        <pre>
    struct Person
    {
        char name[80];
        char address[80];

        void print();
    };
</pre>
    When defining the member function <code>print</code> the structure's name
(<code>Person</code>) and the scope resolution operator (<code>::</code>) are used:
        <pre>
    void Person::print()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Name:      " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n"
                "Address:   " &lt;&lt; address &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
    The implementation of <code>Person::print</code> shows how the fields of the
<code>struct</code> can be accessed without using the structure's type name. Here the
function <code>Person::print</code> prints a variable <code>name</code>. Since <code>Person::print</code>
is itself a part of <code>struct</code> <code>person</code>, the variable <code>name</code> implicitly
refers to the same type.
<p>
This <code>struct Person</code> could be used as follows:
        <pre>
    Person person;

    strcpy(person.name, "Karel");
    strcpy(person.address, "Marskramerstraat 33");
    person.print();
</pre>
    The advantage of member functions is that the called function
automatically accesses the data fields of the structure for which it was
invoked. In the statement <code>person.print()</code> the object <code>person</code> is the
`substrate': the variables <code>name</code> and <code>address</code> that are used in the code
of <code>print</code> refer to the data stored in the <code>person</code> object.
<p>
<a name="HIDING"></a><a name="l33"></a>
<h3>3.2.1: Data hiding: public, private and class</h3>
    As mentioned before (see section <a href="cplusplus02.html#Pretensions">2.3</a>), <strong>C++</strong> contains
specialized syntactic possibilities to implement <a name="an151"></a>data hiding. Data hiding
is the capability of sections of a program to hide its data from other
sections. This results in very clean data definitions. It also allows these
sections to enforce the integrity of their data.
<p>
<strong>C++</strong> has three keywords that are related to data hiding: <a name="an152"></a><code>private</code>,
<a name="an153"></a><code>protected</code> and <a name="an154"></a><code>public</code>. These keywords can be used in the definition of
<code>struct</code>s. The keyword <code>public</code> allows all subsequent fields of a
structure to be accessed by all code; the keyword <code>private</code> only allows code
that is part of the <code>struct</code> itself to access subsequent fields. The keyword
<code>protected</code> is discussed in chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>, and is somewhat
outside of the scope of the current discussion.
<p>
In a <code>struct</code> all fields are <code>public</code>, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Using this knowledge we can expand the <code>struct</code> <code>Person</code>:
        <pre>
    struct Person
    {
        private:
            char d_name[80];
            char d_address[80];
        public:
            void setName(char const *n);
            void setAddress(char const *a);
            void print();
            char const *name();
            char const *address();
    };
</pre>
    As the data fields <code>d_name</code> and <code>d_address</code> are in a <code>private</code>
section they are only accessible to the member functions which are defined in
the <code>struct</code>: these are the functions <code>setName</code>, <code>setAddress</code> etc.. As
an illustration consider the following code:
        <pre>
    Person fbb;

    fbb.setName("Frank");         // OK, setName is public
    strcpy(fbb.d_name, "Knarf");  // error, x.d_name is private
</pre>
    Data integrity is implemented as follows: the actual data of a <code>struct</code>
<code>Person</code> are mentioned in the structure definition. The data are accessed by
the outside world using special functions that are also part of the
definition. These member functions control all traffic between the data fields
and other parts of the program and are therefore also called `interface'
functions.  The thus implemented data hiding is illustrated in
Figure <a href="cplusplus03.html#datahiding">2</a>.
        <a name="datahiding"></a><p><center><img src="first/datahiding.gif" align="bottom" alt="Figure 2 is shown here."/><br>
Figure 2: Private data and public interface functions of the class Person.
</center><p><br>

    The members <code>setName</code> and <code>setAddress</code> are declared with <code>char const
*</code> parameters. This indicates that the functions will not alter the strings
which are supplied as their arguments.  Analogously, the members <code>name</code>
and <code>address</code> return <code>char const *</code>s: the compiler prevents callers of
those members from modifying  the information made accessible through the
return values of those members.
<p>
Two examples of member functions of the <code>struct</code> <code>Person</code> are shown
below:
        <pre>
    void Person::setName(char const *n)
    {
        strncpy(d_name, n, 79);
        d_name[79] = 0;
    }

    char const *Person::name()
    {
        return d_name;
    }
</pre>
    The power of member functions and of the concept of data hiding results
from the abilities of member functions to perform special tasks, e.g.,
checking the validity of the data. In the above example <code>setName</code> copies
only up to 79 characters from its argument to the data member <code>name</code>,
thereby avoiding a <a name="an155"></a>buffer overflow.
<p>
Another illustration of the concept of data hiding is the following. As an
alternative to member functions that keep their data in memory a library could
be developed featuring member functions storing data on file. To convert a
program storing <code>Person</code> structures in memory to one that stores the
data on disk no special modifications are required. After recompilation
and linking the program to a new library it is converted from storage
in memory to storage on disk. This example illustrates a broader concept than
data hiding; it illustrates <a name="an156"></a><em>encapsulation</em>. Data hiding is a kind of
encapsulation. Encapsulation in general results in reduced coupling of
different sections of a program. This in turn greatly enhances reusability and
maintainability of the resulting software. By having the structure encapsulate
the actual storage medium the program using the structure becomes independent
of the actual storage medium that is used.
<p>
Though data hiding can be implemented using <code>struct</code>s, more often (almost
always) <em>classes</em> are used instead. A class is a kind of struct, except that
a class uses private access by default, whereas structs use public access by
default. The definition of a <code>class</code> <code>Person</code> is therefore identical to
the one shown above, except for the fact that the keyword <code>class</code> has
replaced <code>struct</code> while the initial <code>private:</code> clause can be omitted.  Our
typographic suggestion for class names (and other type names defined by the
programmer) is to start with a capital character to be followed by the
remainder of the type name using lower case letters (e.g., <code>Person</code>).

<h3>3.2.2: Structs in C vs. structs in C++</h3>
    In this section we'll discuss an important difference between <strong>C</strong> and
<strong>C++</strong> structs and (member) functions. In <strong>C</strong> it is common to define
several functions to process a <code>struct</code>, which then require a pointer to the
<code>struct</code> as one of their arguments. An imaginary <strong>C</strong> header file showing
this concept is:
        <pre>
    /* definition of a struct PERSON    This is C   */
    typedef struct
    {
        char name[80];
        char address[80];
    } PERSON;

    /* some functions to manipulate PERSON structs */

    /* initialize fields with a name and address    */
    void initialize(PERSON *p, char const *nm,
                       char const *adr);

    /* print information    */
    void print(PERSON const *p);

    /* etc..    */
</pre>
<p>
In <strong>C++</strong>, the declarations of the involved functions are put inside
the definition of the <code>struct</code> or <code>class</code>. The argument denoting
which <code>struct</code> is involved is no longer needed.
        <pre>
    class Person
    {
        char d_name[80];
        char d_address[80];

        public:
            void initialize(char const *nm, char const *adr);
            void print();
            // etc..
    };
</pre>
    In <strong>C++</strong> the <code>struct</code> parameter is not used. A <strong>C</strong> function call
such as:
        <pre>
    PERSON x;

    initialize(&amp;x, "some name", "some address");
</pre>
    becomes in <strong>C++</strong>:
        <pre>
    Person x;

    x.initialize("some name", "some address");
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l35"></a>
<h2>3.3: More extensions to C</h2>
<p>
<a name="l36"></a>
<h3>3.3.1: References</h3>
    In addition to the common ways to define variables (plain variables or
pointers) <strong>C++</strong> introduces <a name="an157"></a><em>references</em> defining synonyms for
variables. A reference to a variable is like an <em>alias</em>; the variable and
the reference can both be used in statements involving the variable:
        <pre>
    int int_value;
    int &amp;ref = int_value;
</pre>
    In the above example a variable <code>int_value</code> is defined. Subsequently a
reference <code>ref</code> is defined, which (due to its initialization) refers to the
same memory location as <code>int_value</code>. In the definition of <code>ref</code>, the
<a name="an158"></a>reference operator <a name="an159"></a> <code>&amp;</code> indicates that <code>ref</code> is not
itself an <code>int</code> but a reference to one. The two statements
        <pre>
    ++int_value;
    ++ref;
</pre>
    have the same effect: they increment <code>int_value</code>'s value.  Whether that
location is called <code>int_value</code> or <code>ref</code> does not matter.
<p>
References serve an important function in <strong>C++</strong> as a means to pass
modifiable arguments to functions. E.g., in standard <strong>C</strong>, a function that
increases the value of its argument by five and returning nothing needs a
pointer parameter:
        <pre>
    void increase(int *valp)    // expects a pointer
    {                           // to an int
        *valp += 5;
    }

    int main()
    {
        int x;

        increase(&amp;x);           // pass x's address
    }
</pre>
    This construction can <em>also</em> be used in <strong>C++</strong> but the same effect
is also achieved using a reference:
        <pre>
    void increase(int &amp;valr)    // expects a reference
    {                           // to an int
        valr += 5;
    }

    int main()
    {
        int x;

        increase(x);            // passed as reference
    }
</pre>
    It is arguable whether code such as the above should be preferred over
<strong>C</strong>'s method, though. The statement <code>increase</code> <code>(x)</code> suggests that not
<code>x</code> itself but a <em>copy</em> is passed. Yet the value of <code>x</code> changes because
of the way <code>increase()</code> is defined. However, references can also be used to
pass objects that are only inspected (without the need for a copy or a const
*) or to pass objects whose modification is an accepted side-effect of their
use. In those cases using references are strongly preferred over existing
alternatives like copy by value or passing pointers.
<p>
Behind the scenes references are implemented using pointers. So, as far as
the compiler is concerned references in <strong>C++</strong> are just const pointers.  With
references, however, the programmer does not need to know or to bother about
levels of indirection. An important distinction between plain pointers and
references is of course that with references no indirection takes place. For
example:
        <pre>
    extern int *ip;
    extern int &amp;ir;

    ip = 0;     // reassigns ip, now a 0-pointer
    ir = 0;     // ir unchanged, the int variable it refers to
                // is now 0.
</pre>
<p>
In order to prevent confusion, we suggest to adhere to the following:
    <ul>
    <li> In those situations where a function does not alter its
parameters of a built-in or pointer type, value parameters can be used:
        <pre>
void some_func(int val)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; val &lt;&lt; '\n';
}

int main()
{
    int x;

    some_func(x);       // a copy is passed
}
</pre>
    <li> When a function explicitly must change the values of its arguments, a
pointer parameter is preferred. These pointer parameters should preferably be
the function's initial parameters. This is called <a name="an160"></a><em>return by argument</em>.
        <pre>
void by_pointer(int *valp)
{
    *valp += 5;
}
</pre>
    <li> When a function doesn't change the value of its class- or struct-type
arguments, or if the modification of the argument is a trivial side-effect
(e.g., the argument is a stream) references can be used. Const-references
should be used if the function does not modify the argument:
        <pre>
void by_reference(string const &amp;str)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; str;    // no modification of str
}

int main ()
{
    int x = 7;
    by_pointer(&amp;x);         // a pointer is passed
                            // x might be changed
    string str("hello");
    by_reference(str);      // str is not altered
}
</pre>
    References play an important role in cases where the argument is not
changed by the function but where it is undesirable to copy the argument to
initialize the parameter. Such a situation occurs when a large object is
passed as argument, or is returned by the function.  In these cases the
copying operation tends to become a significant factor, as the entire
object must be copied. In these cases references are preferred.
<p>
If the argument isn't modified by the function, or if the caller shouldn't
modify the returned information, the <code>const</code> keyword should be
used. Consider the following example:
        <pre>
struct Person                   // some large structure
{
    char    name[80];
    char    address[90];
    double  salary;
};

Person person[50];          // database of persons

                            // printperson expects a
                            // reference to a structure
                            // but won't change it
void printperson (Person const &amp;p)
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Name: " &lt;&lt; p.name &lt;&lt; '\n' &lt;&lt;
            "Address: " &lt;&lt; p.address &lt;&lt; '\n';

}
                            // get a person by indexvalue
Person const &amp;person(int index)
{
    return person[index];   // a reference is returned,
}                           // not a copy of person[index]

int main()
{
    Person boss;

    printperson (boss);     // no pointer is passed,
                            // so variable won't be
                            // altered by the function
    printperson(person(5));
                            // references, not copies
                            // are passed here
}
</pre>
    <li> Furthermore, note that there is yet another reason for using
references when passing objects as function arguments. When passing a
reference to an object, the activation of a so called <em>copy constructor</em>
is avoided. Copy constructors are covered in chapter <a href="cplusplus09.html#MEMORY">9</a>.
    </ul>
<p>
References <em>could</em> result in extremely `ugly' code. A function may
return a reference to a variable, as in the following example:
        <pre>
    int &amp;func()
    {
        static int value;
        return value;
    }
</pre>
    This allows the use of the following constructions:
        <pre>
    func() = 20;
    func() += func();
</pre>
    It is probably superfluous to note that such constructions should normally
not be used. Nonetheless, there are situations where it is useful to return a
reference.  We have actually already seen an example of this phenomenon in our
previous discussion of streams. In a statement like <code>cout</code> &lt;&lt;
<code>"Hello"</code> &lt;&lt; <code>'\n';</code> the insertion operator returns a reference to
<code>cout</code>. So, in this statement first the <code>"Hello"</code> is inserted into
<code>cout</code>, producing a reference to <code>cout</code>. Through this reference the
<code>'\n'</code> is then inserted in the <code>cout</code> object, again producing a reference
to <code>cout</code>, which is then ignored.
<p>
Several differences between pointers and references are pointed out in the
next list below:
    <ul>
    <li> A reference cannot exist by itself, i.e., without something to
refer to. A declaration of a reference like
        <center><code>int &amp;ref;</code></center>
    is not allowed; what would <code>ref</code> refer to?
    <li> References can be declared as <code>external</code>.  These references were
initialized elsewhere.
    <li> References may exist as parameters of functions: they are initialized
when the function is called.
    <li> References may be used in the return types of functions. In those
cases the function determines what the return value refers to.
    <li> References may be used as data members of classes. We return
to this usage later.
    <li> Pointers are variables by themselves. They point at
something concrete or just ``at nothing''.
    <li> References are aliases for other variables and cannot be re-aliased
to another variable. Once a reference is defined, it refers to its particular
variable.
    <li> Pointers (except for const pointers) can be reassigned to point to
different variables.
    <li> When an <a name="an161"></a>address-of operator <a name="an162"></a> <a name="an163"></a><code>&amp;</code> is used with a
reference, the expression yields the address of the variable to which the
reference applies. In contrast, ordinary pointers are variables themselves, so
the address of a pointer variable has nothing to do with the address of the
variable pointed to.
    </ul>

<h3>3.3.2: Rvalue References</h3>
    In <strong>C++</strong>, temporary (rvalue) values are indistinguishable from
<code>const &amp;</code> types. the C++11 standard adds a new reference type called an
    <a name="an164"></a><em>rvalue reference</em>, defined as
    <a name="an165"></a><code>typename &amp;&amp;</code>.
<p>
The name <em>rvalue</em> reference is derived from assignment statements, where the
variable to the left of the assignment operator is called an <a name="an166"></a><em>lvalue</em> and
the expression to the right of the assignment operator is called an
<a name="an167"></a><em>rvalue</em>. Rvalues are often temporary (or anonymous) values, like values
returned by functions.
<p>
In this parlance the <strong>C++</strong> reference should be considered an
 <a name="an168"></a><em>lvalue reference</em> (using the notation <code>typename &amp;</code>). They can be
contrasted to <em>rvalue references</em> (using the notation <code>typename &amp;&amp;</code>).
<p>
The key to understanding rvalue references is the concept of an
 <a name="an169"></a><em>anonymous variable</em>. An anonymous variable has no name and this is the
distinguishing feature for the compiler to associate it automatically with an
rvalue reference if it has a choice. Before introducing some interesting and
new constructions that weren't available before C++11 let's first have a look
at some standard situations where <em>lvalue</em> references are used. The
following function returns a temporary (anonymous) value:
        <pre>
    int intVal()
    {
        return 5;
    }
</pre>
    Although <code>intVal</code>'s return value  can be assigned to an <code>int</code>
variable it requires copying, which might become prohibitive when
a function does not return an <code>int</code> but instead some large object. A
<em>reference</em> or <em>pointer</em> cannot be used either to collect the anonymous
return value as the return value won't survive beyond that. So the following
is illegal (as noted by the compiler):
        <pre>
    int &amp;ir = intVal();         // fails: refers to a temporary
    int const &amp;ic = intVal();   // OK: immutable temporary
    int *ip = &amp;intVal();        // fails: no lvalue available
</pre>
<p>
Apparently it is not possible to modify the temporary returned by
<code>intVal</code>. But now consider these functions:
        <pre>
    void receive(int &amp;value)            // note: lvalue reference
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "int value parameter\n";
    }
    void receive(int &amp;&amp;value)           // note: rvalue reference
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "int R-value parameter\n";
    }
</pre>
    and let's call this function from <code>main</code>:
        <pre>
    int main()
    {
        receive(18);
        int value = 5;
        receive(value);
        receive(intVal());
    }
</pre>
    This program produces the following output:
        <pre>
    int R-value parameter
    int value parameter
    int R-value parameter
</pre>
    The program's output shows the compiler selecting <code>receive(int &amp;&amp;value)</code>
in all cases where it receives an anonymous <code>int</code> as its argument. Note that
this includes <code>receive(18)</code>: a value 18 has no name and thus <code>receive(int
&amp;&amp;value)</code> is called. Internally, it actually uses a temporary variable to
store the 18, as is shown by the following example which modifies <code>receive</code>:
        <pre>
    void receive(int &amp;&amp;value)
    {
        ++value;
        cout &lt;&lt; "int R-value parameter, now: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; '\n';
            // displays 19 and 6, respectively.
    }
</pre>
    Contrasting <code>receive(int &amp;value)</code> with <code>receive(int &amp;&amp;value)</code> has
nothing to do with <code>int &amp;value</code> not being a const reference. If
<code>receive(int const &amp;value)</code> is used the same results are obtained. Bottom
line: the compiler selects the overloaded function using the rvalue reference
if the function is passed an anonymous value.
<p>
The compiler runs into problems if <code>void receive(int &amp;value)</code> is
replaced by <code>void receive(int value)</code>, though. When confronted with the
choice between a value parameter and a reference parameter (either lvalue or
rvalue) it cannot make a decision and reports an ambiguity. In practical
contexts this is not a problem. Rvalue refences were added to the language in
order to be able to distinguish the two forms of references: named values
(for which lvalue references are used) and anonymous values (for which
rvalue references are used).
<p>
It is this distinction that allows the implementation of
 <a name="an170"></a><em>move semantics</em> and <a name="an171"></a><em>perfect forwarding</em>. At this point the concept of
<a name="an172"></a><em>move semantics</em> cannot yet fully be discussed (but see section <a href="cplusplus09.html#MOVE">9.7</a>
for a more thorough discussusion) but it is very well possible to illustrate
the underlying ideas.
<p>
Consider the situation where a function returns a <code>struct Data</code> containing a
pointer to dynamically allocated characters. Moreover, the struct defines a
member function <code>copy(Data const &amp;other)</code> that takes another <code>Data</code> object
and copies the other's data into the current object. The (partial) definition
of the <code>struct Data</code> might look like this&nbsp;(To the observant reader:
in this example the memory leak that results from using Data::copy()
should be ignored):
        <pre>
    struct Data
    {
        char *text;
        size_t size;
        void copy(Data const &amp;other)
        {
            text = strdup(other.text);
            size = strlen(text);
        }
    };
</pre>
    Next, functions <code>dataFactory</code> and <code>main</code> are defined as follows:
        <pre>
    Data dataFactory(char const *txt)
    {
        Data ret = {strdup(txt), strlen(txt)};
        return ret;
    }

    int main()
    {
        Data d1 = {strdup("hello"), strlen("hello")};

        Data d2;
        d2.copy(d1);                        // 1 (see text)

        Data d3;
        d3.copy(dataFactory("hello"));      // 2
    }
</pre>
    At (1) <code>d2</code> appropriately receives a copy of <code>d1</code>'s text. But at (2)
<code>d3</code> receives a copy of the text stored in the temporary returned by the
<code>dataFactory</code> function. As the temporary ceases to exist after the call to
<code>copy()</code> two releated and unpleasant consequences are observed:
        <ul>
        <li> The return value is a temporary object: its only reason for
existence is to pass its data on to <code>d3</code>. Now <code>d3</code> copies the
temporary's data which clearly is somewhat overdone.
        <li> The temporary <code>Data</code> object is lost following the call to
<code>copy()</code>. Unfortunately its dynamically allocated data is lost as well
resulting in a memory leak.
        </ul>
    In cases like these <em>rvalue reference</em> should be used. By overloading
the <code>copy</code> member with a member <code>copy(Data &amp;&amp;other)</code> the compiler is able
to distinguish situations (1) and (2). It now calls the initial <code>copy()</code>
member in situation (1) and the newly defined overloaded <code>copy()</code> member in
situation (2):
        <pre>
    struct Data
    {
        char *text;
        size_t size;
        void copy(Data const &amp;other)
        {
            text = strdup(other.text);
        }
        void copy(Data &amp;&amp;other)
        {
            text = other.text;
            other.text = 0;
        }
    };
</pre>
    Note that the overloaded <code>copy()</code> function merely moves the
<code>other.text</code> pointer to the current object's <code>text</code> pointer followed by
reassigning 0 to <code>other.text</code>. <code>Struct Data</code> suddenly has become
<a name="an173"></a><em>move-aware</em> and implements <em>move semantics</em>, removing the drawbacks of
the previously shown approach:
    <ul>
    <li> Instead of making a deep copy (which is required in situation (1)),
the pointer value is simply moved to its new owner;
    <li> Since the <code>other.text</code> doesn't point to dynamically allocated
memory anymore the memory leak is prevented.
    </ul>
<p>
Rvalue references for <code>*this</code> and initialization of class
objects by rvalues are not yet supported by the <code>g++</code> compiler.
<p>
<a name="l38"></a>
<h3>3.3.3: Strongly typed enumerations</h3>
    Enumeration values in <strong>C++</strong> are in fact <code>int</code> values, thereby bypassing
type safety. E.g., values of different enumeration types may  be
compared for (in)equality, albeit through a (static) type cast.
<p>
Another problem with the current <code>enum</code> type is that their values are not
restricted to the enum type name itself, but to the scope where the
enumeration is defined. As a consequence, two enumerations having the same
scope cannot have identical values.
<p>
In the C++11 standard these problems are solved by defining
    <em>enum classes</em>. An <a name="an174"></a><em>enum class</em> can be defined as in the following
example:
        <pre>
    enum class SafeEnum
    {
        NOT_OK,     // 0, by implication
        OK          = 10,
        MAYBE_OK    // 11, by implication
    };
</pre>
    Enum classes use <code>int</code> values by default, but the used value type can
easily be changed using the <code>: type</code> notation, as in:
        <pre>
    enum class CharEnum: unsigned char
    {
        NOT_OK,
        OK
    };
</pre>
    To use a value defined in an enum class its enumeration name must be
provided as well. E.g., <code>OK</code> is not defined, <code>CharEnum::OK</code> is.
<p>
Using the data type specification (noting that it defaults to <code>int</code>) it
is possible to use enum class forward declarations.
        <a name="an175"></a>
    E.g.,
        <pre>
    enum Enum1;                 // Illegal: no size available
    enum Enum2: unsigned int;   // Legal in C++11: explicitly declared type

    enum class Enum3;           // Legal in C++11: default int type is used
    enum class Enum4: char;     // Legal in C++11: explicitly declared type
</pre>

<h3>3.3.4: Initializer lists</h3>
    The <strong>C</strong> language defines the <a name="an176"></a>initializer list as a list of values enclosed
by curly braces, possibly themselves containing initializer lists. In <strong>C</strong>
these initializer lists are commonly used to initialize arrays and structs.
<p>
<strong>C++</strong> extends this concept in the C++11 standard by introducing the
<em>type</em>
    <a name="an177"></a><code>initializer_list&lt;Type&gt;</code> where <code>Type</code> is replaced by the type name of
the values used in the initializer list. Initializer lists in <strong>C++</strong> are,
like their counterparts in <strong>C</strong>, recursive, so they can also be used with
multi-dimensional arrays, structs and classes.
<p>
Before using the <code>initializer_list</code> the <a name="an178"></a><code>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</code> header file
must have been included.
<p>
Like in <strong>C</strong>, initializer lists consist of a list of values surrounded by
curly braces. But unlike <strong>C</strong>, <em>functions</em> can define initializer list
parameters. E.g.,
        <pre>
    void values(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; iniValues)
    {
    }
</pre>
    A function like <code>values</code> could be called as follows:
        <pre>
    values({2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13});
</pre>
    The initializer list appears as an argument which is a  list of values
surrounded by curly braces. Due to the recursive nature of initializer lists a
two-dimensional series of values can also be passes, as shown in the next
example:
        <pre>
    void values2(std::initializer_list&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt; iniValues)
    {
    }

    values2({{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 5}, {4, 7}, {5, 11}, {6, 13}});
</pre>
    Initializer lists are constant expressions and cannot be
modified. However, their <em>size</em> and values may be retrieved using their
<code>size, begin</code>, and <code>end</code> members as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    void values(initializer_list&lt;int&gt; iniValues)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Initializer list having " &lt;&lt; iniValues.size() &lt;&lt; "values\n";
        for
        (
            initializer_list&lt;int&gt;::const_iterator begin = iniValues.begin();
                begin != iniValues.end();
                    ++begin
        )
            cout &lt;&lt; "Value: " &lt;&lt; *begin &lt;&lt; '\n';
    }
</pre>
<p>
Initializer lists can also be used to initialize objects of classes
(cf. section <a href="cplusplus07.html#UNIFORMINIT">7.5</a>).
<p>
<a name="AUTO"></a><a name="l40"></a>
<h3>3.3.5: Type inference using `auto'</h3>
    A special use of the keyword <a name="an179"></a><code>auto</code> is defined by the C++11 standard
allowing the compiler to determine the type of a variable automatically rather
than requiring the software engineer to define a variable's type explicitly.
<p>
In parallel, the use of <code>auto</code> as a storage class specifier is no longer
supported in the C++11 standard. According to that standard a variable
definition like <code>auto int var</code> results in a compilation error.
<p>
This can be very useful in situations where it is very hard to determine the
variable's type in advance. These situations occur, e.g., in the context of
<em>templates</em>, topics covered in chapters <a href="cplusplus18.html#STL">18</a> until <a href="cplusplus22.html#ADVANCEDTEMPL">22</a>.
<p>
At this point in the Annotations only simple examples can be given. Also, some
hints will be provided about more general uses of the <code>auto</code> keyword.
<p>
When defining and initializing a variable <code>int variable = 5</code> the type of the
initializing expression is well known: it's an <code>int</code>, and unless the
programmer's intentions are different this could be used to define
<code>variable</code>'s type (although it shouldn't in normal circumstances as it
reduces rather than improves the clarity of the code):
        <pre>
    auto variable = 5;
</pre>
<p>
Here are some examples where using <code>auto</code> <em>is</em> useful.
In chapter <a href="cplusplus05.html#String">5</a> the <a name="an180"></a><em>iterator</em> concept is introduced (see also
chapters <a href="cplusplus12.html#CONTAINERS">12</a> and <a href="cplusplus18.html#STL">18</a>). Iterators sometimes have long type
definitions, like
        <pre>
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;::const_reverse_iterator
</pre>
    Functions may return types like this. Since the compiler knows the
types returned by functions we may exploit this knowledge using
<code>auto</code>. Assuming that a function <code>begin()</code> is declared as follows:
        <pre>
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;::const_reverse_iterator begin();
</pre>
    Rather than writing the verbose variable definition (at <code>//
1</code>) a much shorter definition (at <code>// 2</code>) may be used:
        <pre>
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;::const_reverse_iterator iter = begin();    // 1
    auto iter = begin();                                                // 2
</pre>
    It's easy to define additional variables of this type. When initializing
those variables using <code>iter</code> the <code>auto</code> keyword can be used again:
        <pre>
    auto start = iter;
</pre>
<p>
If <code>start</code> can't be initialized immediately using an existing
variable the type of a well known variable or function can be used in
combination with the <a name="an181"></a><code>decltype</code> keyword, as in:
        <pre>
    decltype(iter) start;
    decltype(begin()) spare;
</pre>
    The keyword <code>decltype</code> may also receive an expression as its
argument. This feature is already available in the C++11 standard
implementation in g++ 4.3. E.g., <code>decltype(3 + 5)</code> represents an int,
<code>decltype(3 / double(3))</code> represents <code>double</code>.
<p>
The <code>auto</code> keyword can also be used to postpone the definition of a
function's return type. The declaration of a function <code>intArrPtr</code> returning
a pointer to an array of 10 <code>int</code>s looks like this:
        <pre>
    int (*intArrPtr())[10];
</pre>
    Such a declaration is fairly complex. E.g., among other complexities it
requires `protection of the pointer'<a name="an182"></a> using parentheses
in combination with the function's parameter list. In situations like these
the specification of the return type can be postponed using the <code>auto</code>
return type, followed by the specification of the function's return type after
any other specification the function might receive (e.g., as a const member
(cf. section <a href="cplusplus07.html#ConstFunctions">7.7</a>) or following its <code>noexcept</code> specification
(cf. section <a href="cplusplus22.html#NOEXCEPT">22.7</a>)).
<p>
Using <code>auto</code> to declare the above function, the declaration becomes:
        <pre>
    auto intArrPtr() -&gt; int (*)[10];
</pre>
    A return type specification using <code>auto</code> is called a
        <a name="an183"></a><em>late-specified return type</em>.
<p>
The <code>auto</code> keyword can also be used to defined types that are related to
the actual <code>auto</code> associated type. Here are some examples:
        <pre>
    vector&lt;int&gt; vi;
    auto iter = vi.begin();     // standard: auto is vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator
    auto &amp;&amp;rref = vi.begin();   // auto is rvalue ref. to the iterator type
    auto *ptr = &amp;iter;          // auto is pointer to the iterator type
    auto *ptr = &amp;rref;          // same
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l41"></a>
<h3>3.3.6: Defining types and 'using' declarations</h3>
    In <strong>C++</strong> <code>typedef</code> is commonly used to define shorthand notations for
complex types. Assume we want to define a shorthand for `a pointer to a
function expecting a double and an int, and returning an unsigned long long
int'. Such a function could be:
        <pre>
    unsigned long long int compute(double, int);
</pre>
    A pointer to such a function has the following form:
        <pre>
    unsigned long long int (*pf)(double, int);
</pre>
    If this kind of pointer is frequently used, consider defining it using
<code>typedef</code>: simply put <code>typedef</code> in front of it and the pointer's name is
turned into the name of a type. It could be capitalized to let it stand out
more clearly as the name of a type:
        <pre>
    typedef unsigned long long int (*PF)(double, int);
</pre>
    After having defined this type, it can be used to declare or define such
pointers:
        <pre>
    PF pf = compute;        // initialize the pointer to a function like
                            // 'compute'
    void fun(PF pf);        // fun expects a pointer to a function like
                            // 'compute'
</pre>
    However, including the pointer in the typedef might not be a very good
idea, as it masks the fact that <code>pf</code> is a pointer. After all, <code>PF pf</code>
looks more like `<code>int x</code>' than `<code>int *x</code>'. To document that <code>pf</code> is
in fact a pointer, slightly change the <code>typedef</code>:
        <pre>
    typedef unsigned long long int FUN(double, int);

    FUN *pf = compute;      // now pf clearly is a pointer.
</pre>
    The scope of typedefs is restricted to compilation units. Therefore,
typedefs are usually embedded in header files which are then included by
multiple source files in which the typedefs should be used.
<p>
In addition to <code>typedef</code> the C++11 standard offers the <a name="an184"></a><code>using</code> keyword to
associate a type and and identifier. In practice <code>typedef</code> and <code>using</code> can
be used interchangeably. The <code>using</code> keyword arguably result in more
readable type definitions. Consider the following three (equivalent)
definitions:
    <ul>
    <li> The traditional, <strong>C</strong> style definition of a type, embedding the type
        name in the definition (turning a variable name into a type name):
    <pre>
typedef unsigned long long int FUN(double, int);
</pre>
    <li> Apply <code>using</code> to improve the visibility (for humans) of the type
        name, by moving the type  name to the front of the definition:
    <pre>
using FUN = unsigned long long int (double, int);
</pre>
    <li> An alternative construction, using a late-specified return type
        (cf. section <a href="cplusplus03.html#AUTO">3.3.5</a>):
    <pre>
using FUN = auto (double, int) -&gt; unsigned long long int;
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l42"></a>
<h3>3.3.7: Range-based for-loops</h3>
    The <strong>C++</strong> for-statement is identical to <strong>C</strong>'s for-statement:
        <pre>
    for (init; cond; inc)
        statement
</pre>
    Often the initialization, condition, and increment parts are fairly
obvious, as in situations where all elements of an array or vector must be
processed. Many languages offer the <code>foreach</code> statement for that and <strong>C++</strong>
offers the <code>std::for_each</code> generic algorithm (cf. section <a href="cplusplus19.html#FOREACH">19.1.17</a>).
<p>
The C++11 standard adds new syntax for the <code>for</code>-statement: the
    <a name="an185"></a><em>range based for</em> <em>loop</em>. This new syntax can be used to process all
element of a <a name="an186"></a>range in turn. Three types of ranges are distinguished:
        <ul>
        <li> Plain arrays (e.g., <code>int array[10]</code>);
        <li> Initializer lists;
        <li> Standard containers (or comparable) (cf. chapter
            <a href="cplusplus12.html#CONTAINERS">12</a>);
        <li> Any other type offering <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code> functions
            returning so-called <em>iterators</em> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus18.html#ITERATORS">18.2</a>).
        </ul>
<p>
In these cases the C++11 standard offers the following additional
<a name="an187"></a>for-statement syntax:
        <pre>
    // assume int array[30]
    for (auto &amp;element: array)
        statement
</pre>
    The part to the left of the colon is called the
    <a name="an188"></a><em>for range declaration</em>. The declared variable (<code>element</code>) is a
formal name; use any identifier you like. The variable is only
available within the nested statement, and it refers to (or is a copy of) each
of the elements of the range, from the first element up to the last.
<p>
There's no formal requirement to use <code>auto</code>, but using <code>auto</code> is extremely
useful in many situations. Not only in situations where the range refers to
elements of some complex type, but also in situations where you know what you
can do with the elements in the range, but don't care about their exact type
names. In the above example <code>int</code> could also have been used.
<p>
The reference symbol (<code>&amp;</code>) is important in the following cases:
    <ul>
    <li> if you want to modify the elements in the nested statements
    <li> if the elements themselves are <code>struct</code>s (or <em>classes</em>,
        cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus07.html#Classes">7</a>)
    </ul>
    When the reference symbol is omitted the variable will be a copy of each
of the subsequent elements of the range. Fine, probably, if you merely need to
look at the variables when they are of primitive types, but needlessly
inefficient if you have an array of <code>BigStruct</code> elements:
        <pre>
    struct BigStruct
    {
        double array[100];
        int    last;
    };
</pre>
    Inefficient, because you don't need to make copies of the array's
elements. Instead, use refences to elements:
        <pre>
    BigStruct data[100];    // assume properly initialized elsewhere

    int countUsed()
    {
        int sum = 0;
                            // const &amp;: the elements aren't modified
        for (auto const &amp;element: data)
            sum += element.last;
        return sum;
    }
</pre>
    If <code>data</code> is only available as a pointer to its first element in
combination with the number of elements, range-based for loops can also be
used, but require a little help. Section <a href="cplusplus23.html#RANGER">23.5</a> describes a generic
approach to using range based for loops in such cases.
<p>
<a name="l43"></a>
<h3>3.3.8: Raw String Literals</h3>
    Standard ASCII-C strings are delimited by double quotes, supporting
 <a name="an189"></a> escape sequences like <code>\n, \\</code> and <code>\"</code>. In some
cases it is useful to avoid escaping strings (e.g., in the context of XML). To
this end, the C++11 standard offers <a name="an190"></a> <em>raw string
literals</em>.
<p>
Raw string literals start with an <code>R</code>, followed by a double quote, followed
by a label (which is an arbitrary sequence of characters not equal to
<code>(</code>), followed by <code>(</code>. The raw string ends at the closing
parenthesis <code>)</code>, followed by the label which is in turn followed by a
double quote. Example:
        <pre>
    R"(A Raw \ "String")"
    R"delimiter(Another \ Raw "(String))delimiter"
</pre>
    In the first case, everything between <code>"(</code> and <code>)"</code> is
part of the string. Escape sequences aren't supported so the text <code>\ "</code>
within the first raw string literal defines three characters: a backslash, a
blank character and a double quote. The second example shows a raw string
defined between the markers <code>"delimiter(</code> and <code>)delimiter"</code>.
<p>
<a name="l44"></a>
<h2>3.4: New language-defined data types</h2>
In <strong>C</strong> the following <a name="an191"></a>built-in data types are available: <code>void, char,
short, int, long, float</code> and <code>double</code>. <strong>C++</strong> extends these built-in types
with several additional built-in types: the types <a name="an192"></a><code>bool</code>, <a name="an193"></a><code>wchar_t</code>,
<a name="an194"></a><code>long long</code> and <a name="an195"></a><code>long double</code> (Cf. <a name="an196"></a>ANSI/ISO draft (1995),
par. 27.6.2.4.1 for examples of these very long types).  The type
 <a name="an197"></a><code>long long</code> is merely a double-long <code>long</code> datatype. The type
 <a name="an198"></a><code>long double</code> is merely a double-long <code>double</code> datatype. These built-in
types as well as pointer variables are called
 <a name="an199"></a><em>primitive types</em><a name="an200"></a> in the <strong>C++</strong> Annotations.
<p>
There is a subtle issue to be aware of when converting applications developed
for 32-bit architectures to 64-bit architectures. When converting 32-bit
programs to 64-bit programs, only <code>long</code> types and pointer types change in
size from 32 bits to 64 bits; integers of type <code>int</code> remain at their size of
32 bits. This may cause data truncation when assigning pointer or <code>long</code>
types to <code>int</code> types. Also, problems with sign extension can occur when
assigning expressions using types shorter than the size of an <code>int</code> to an
<code>unsigned long</code> or to a pointer. More information about this issue can be
found
 <a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/ILP32toLP64Issues.html">here</a>.
<p>
Except for these built-in types the class-type <code>string</code> is available
for handling character strings. The datatypes <code>bool</code>, and <code>wchar_t</code> are
covered in the following sections, the datatype <code>string</code> is covered in
chapter <a href="cplusplus05.html#String">5</a>. Note that recent versions of <strong>C</strong> may also have adopted
some of these newer data types (notably <code>bool</code> and <code>wchar_t</code>).
Traditionally, however, <strong>C</strong> doesn't support them, hence they are mentioned
here.
<p>
Now that these new types are introduced, let's refresh your memory about
<em>letters</em> that can be used in <a name="an201"></a><em>literal constants</em> of various
 <a name="an202"></a> types. They are:
    <ul>
    <li> <a name="an203"></a><code>b</code> or <code>B</code>: in addition to its use to indicate a hexadecimal
value, it can also be used to define a <a name="an204"></a><em>binary constant</em>. E.g., <code>0b101</code>
equals the decimal value 5 (supported by, e.g., the <code>g++</code> compiler, but not
part of the C++11 standard).
    <li> <a name="an205"></a><code>E</code> or <code>e</code>: <a name="an206"></a> the
<a name="an207"></a><em>exponentiation</em> character in floating point literal values. For example:
<code>1.23E+3</code>. Here, <code>E</code> should be pronounced (and interpreted) as: <em>times 10
to the power</em>. Therefore, <code>1.23E+3</code> represents the value <code>1230</code>.
    <li> <a name="an208"></a><code>F</code> <a name="an209"></a> can be used as <em>postfix</em> to a
non-integral numeric constant to indicate a value of type <code>float</code>, rather
than <code>double</code>, which is the default. For example: <code>12.F</code> (the dot
transforms 12 into a floating point value); <code>1.23E+3F</code> (see the previous
example. <code>1.23E+3</code> is a <code>double</code> value, whereas <code>1.23E+3F</code> is a
<code>float</code> value).
    <li> <a name="an210"></a><code>L</code> <a name="an211"></a> can be used as <em>prefix</em> to
indicate a character string whose elements are <code>wchar_t</code>-type
characters. For example: <code>L"hello world"</code>.
    <li> <code>L</code> <a name="an212"></a> can be used as <em>postfix</em> to an
integral value to indicate a value of type <code>long</code>, rather than <code>int</code>,
which is the default. Note that there is no letter indicating a <code>short</code>
type. For that a <code>static_cast&lt;short&gt;()</code> must be used.
    <li> <a name="an213"></a><code>p</code>, to specify the power <a name="an214"></a> in
hexadecimal floating point numbers.  E.g. <code>0x10p4</code>. The exponent itself is
read as a decimal constant and can therefore not start with 0x. The exponent
part is interpreted as a power of 2. So <code>0x10p2</code> is (decimal) equal to 64:
<code>16 * 2^2</code>.
    <li> <a name="an215"></a><code>U</code> <a name="an216"></a> can be used as <em>postfix</em> to an
integral value to indicate an <code>unsigned</code>  value, rather than an <code>int</code>.
It may also be combined with the postfix <code>L</code> to produce an <code>unsigned long
int</code> value.
    </ul>
    And, of course: the <code>x</code> and <code>a</code> until <code>f</code> characters can be used to
specify hexadecimal constants (optionally using capital letters).
<p>
<a name="BOOL"></a><a name="l45"></a>
<h3>3.4.1: The data type `bool'</h3>
        The type <code>bool</code> represents boolean (logical) values, for which the (now
reserved) constants <a name="an217"></a><code>true</code> and <a name="an218"></a><code>false</code> may be used. Except for these
reserved values, integral values may also be assigned to variables of type
<code>bool</code>, which are then implicitly converted to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
according to the following <a name="an219"></a>conversion rules (assume <code>intValue</code> is an
<code>int</code>-variable, and <code>boolValue</code> is a <code>bool</code>-variable):
        <pre>
        // from int to bool:
    boolValue = intValue ? true : false;

        // from bool to int:
    intValue = boolValue ? 1 : 0;
</pre>
    Furthermore, when <code>bool</code> values are inserted into streams then <code>true</code>
is represented by <code>1</code>, and <code>false</code> is represented by <code>0</code>. Consider the
following example:
        <pre>
    cout &lt;&lt; "A true value: "  &lt;&lt; true &lt;&lt; "\n"
            "A false value: " &lt;&lt; false &lt;&lt; '\n';
</pre>
    The <code>bool</code> data type is found in other programming languages as
well. <strong>Pascal</strong> has its type <code>Boolean</code>; <strong>Java</strong> has a <code>boolean</code>
type. Different from these languages, <strong>C++</strong>'s type <code>bool</code> acts like a kind
of <code>int</code> type. It is primarily a documentation-improving type, having just
two values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. Actually, these values can be interpreted
as <code>enum</code> values for <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>. Doing so would ignore the philosophy
behind the <code>bool</code> data type, but nevertheless: assigning <code>true</code> to an
<code>int</code> variable neither produces warnings nor errors.
<p>
Using the <code>bool</code>-type is usually clearer than using
<code>int</code>. Consider the following prototypes:
        <pre>
    bool exists(char const *fileName);  // (1)
    int  exists(char const *fileName);  // (2)
</pre>
    With the first prototype, readers expect the function to
return <code>true</code> if the given filename is the name of an existing
file. However, with the second prototype some ambiguity arises: intuitively
the return value 1 is appealing, as it allows constructions like
        <pre>
    if (exists("myfile"))
        cout &lt;&lt; "myfile exists";
</pre>
    On the other hand, many system functions (like <a name="an220"></a><code>access</code>, <a name="an221"></a><code>stat</code>, and
many other) return 0 to indicate a successful operation, reserving other
values to indicate various types of errors.
<p>
As a rule of thumb I suggest the following: if a function should inform
its caller about the success or failure of its task, let the function return a
<code>bool</code> value. If the function should return success or various types of
errors, let the function return <em>enum</em> values, documenting the situation by
its various symbolic constants. Only when the function returns a conceptually
meaningful integral value (like the sum of two <code>int</code> values), let the
function return an <code>int</code> value.

<h3>3.4.2: The data type `wchar_t'</h3>
    The <a name="an222"></a><code>wchar_t</code> type is an extension of the <code>char</code> built-in type, to accomodate
<em>wide</em> character values (but see also the next section).  The <code>g++</code>
compiler reports <code>sizeof(wchar_t)</code> as 4, which easily accomodates all 65,536
different <em>Unicode</em> character values.
<p>
Note that <strong>Java</strong>'s <code>char</code> data type is somewhat comparable to <strong>C++</strong>'s
<code>wchar_t</code> type. <strong>Java</strong>'s <code>char</code> type is 2 bytes wide, though. On the
other hand, <strong>Java</strong>'s <code>byte</code> data type is comparable to <strong>C++</strong>'s <code>char</code>
type: one byte. Confusing?
<p>
<a name="UNICODE"></a><a name="l47"></a>
<h3>3.4.3: Unicode encoding</h3>
    In <strong>C++</strong> string literals can be defined as NTB strings.  Prepending an NTBS
by <code>L</code> (e.g., <code>L"hello"</code>) defines a <code>wchar_t</code> string literal.
<p>
The new C++11 standard adds to this support for 8, 16 and 32 bit
<a name="an223"></a>Unicode encoded strings. Furthermore, two new data types are introduced:
<code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> storing, respectively, a
<a name="an224"></a><code>UTF-16</code> and <a name="an225"></a><code>UTF-32</code> unicode value.
<p>
In addition, a <code>char</code> type variable is large enough to contain any <a name="an226"></a><code>UTF-8</code>
unicode value as well (i.e., it remains an 8-bit value).
<p>
String literals for the various types of unicode encodings (and
associated variables) can be defined as follows:
        <pre>
    char     utf_8[] = u8"This is UTF-8 encoded.";
    char16_t utf16[] = u"This is UTF-16 encoded.";
    char32_t utf32[] = U"This is UTF-32 encoded.";
</pre>
    Alternatively, unicode constants may be defined using the <a name="an227"></a><code>\u</code> escape
sequence, followed by a hexadecimal value. Depending on the type of the
unicode variable (or constant) a <code>UTF-8, UTF-16</code> or <code>UTF-32</code> value is
used. E.g.,
        <pre>
    char     utf_8[] = u8"\u2018";
    char16_t utf16[] = u"\u2018";
    char32_t utf32[] = U"\u2018";
</pre>
    Unicode strings can be delimited by double quotes but raw string literals
can also be used.

<h3>3.4.4: The data type `long long int'</h3>
    The C++11 standard adds the type <a name="an228"></a><code>long long int</code> to the set of standard
types. On 32 bit systems it has at least 64 usable bits. Some compilers
already supported <code>long long int</code> as an extension, but C++11 officially
adds it to <strong>C++</strong>.
<p>
<a name="l49"></a>
<h3>3.4.5: The data type `size_t'</h3>
    The <a name="an229"></a><code>size_t</code> type is not really a built-in primitive data type, but a data
type that is promoted by <a name="an230"></a><strong>POSIX</strong> as a typename to be used for non-negative
integral values answering questions like `how much' and `how many', in which
case it should be used instead of <a name="an231"></a><code>unsigned int</code>. It is not a specific
<strong>C++</strong> type, but also available in, e.g., <strong>C</strong>. Usually it is defined
implictly when a (any) system header file is included. The header file
`officially' defining <code>size_t</code> in the context of <strong>C++</strong> is <a name="an232"></a><code>cstddef</code>.
<p>
Using <code>size_t</code> has the advantage of being a <em>conceptual</em> type, rather than
a standard type that is then modified by a modifier. Thus, it improves
the self-documenting value of source code.
<p>
Sometimes functions explictly require <code>unsigned int</code> to be used. E.g., on
<a name="an233"></a><code>amd</code>-architectures the <a name="an234"></a>X-windows function <a name="an235"></a><code>XQueryPointer</code> explicitly
requires a pointer to an <code>unsigned int</code> variable as one of its arguments. In
such situations a pointer to a <code>size_t</code> variable can't be used, but the
address of an <code>unsigned int</code> must be provided. Such situations are
exceptional, though.
<p>
Other useful bit-represented types also exists. E.g., <a name="an236"></a><code>uint32_t</code> is
guaranteed to hold 32-bits unsigned values. Analogously, <a name="an237"></a><code>int32_t</code> holds
32-bits signed values. Corresponding types exist for 8, 16 and 64 bits
values. These types are defined in the header file <a name="an238"></a><code>cstdint</code>.
<p>
<a name="CPPCASTS"></a><a name="l50"></a>
<h2>3.5: A new syntax for casts</h2>
Traditionally, <strong>C</strong> offers the following <em>cast</em> syntax:
            <pre>
        (typename)expression
</pre>
 here <code>typename</code> is the name of a valid <em>type</em>, and <code>expression</code> is an
expression.
<p>
<strong>C</strong> style casts are now deprecated. <strong>C++</strong> programs should merely use
the new style <strong>C++</strong> casts as they offer the compiler facilities to verify
the sensibility of the cast. Facilities which are not offered by the classic
<strong>C</strong>-style cast.
<p>
A cast should not be confused with the often used
    <a name="an239"></a><em>constructor notation</em>:
        <pre>
    typename(expression)
</pre>
 the constructor notation is not a cast, but a request to the compiler to
construct an (anonymous) variable of type <code>typename</code> from <code>expression</code>.
<p>
If casts are really necessary one of several <a name="an240"></a><em>new-style casts</em> should be
used. These new-style casts are introduced in the upcoming sections.
<p>
<a name="l51"></a>
<h3>3.5.1: The `static_cast'-operator</h3>
    The <a name="an241"></a><code>static_cast&lt;type&gt;(expression)</code> is used to convert `conceptually
comparable or related types' to each other. Here as well as in other <strong>C++</strong>
style casts <code>type</code> is the type to which the type of <code>expression</code> should be
cast.
<p>
Here are some examples of situations where the <code>static_cast</code> can (or should)
be used:
    <ul>
    <li> When converting an <code>int</code> to a <code>double</code>. <br>
<p>
This happens, for example when the quotient of two <code>int</code> values must be
computed without losing the fraction part of the division. The <code>sqrt</code>
function called in the following fragment returns 2:
    <pre>
int x = 19;
int y = 4;
sqrt(x / y);
</pre>
    whereas it returns 2.179 when a <code>static_cast</code> is used, as in:
    <pre>
sqrt(static_cast&lt;double&gt;(x) / y);
</pre>
    The important point to notice here is that a <code>static_cast</code> is allowed to
change the representation of its <code>expression</code> into the representation that's
used by the destination type.
<p>
Also note that the division is put outside of the cast expression. If the
division is performed within the cast's <code>expression</code> (as in
<code>static_cast&lt;double&gt;(x / y)</code>) an <a name="an242"></a><em>integer division</em> has already been
performed <em>before</em> the cast has had a chance to convert the type of an
operand to <code>double</code>.
<p>
<li> When converting <code>enum</code> values to <code>int</code> values (in any
direction). <br>
<p>
Here the two types use identical representations, but different
semantics. Assigning an ordinary <code>enum</code> value to an <code>int</code> doesn't require
a cast, but when the enum is a <em>strongly typed enum</em> a cast <em>is</em>
required. Conversely, a <code>static_cast</code> is required when assigning an <code>int</code>
value to a variable of some enum type. Here is an example:
    <pre>
enum class Enum
{
    VALUE
};

cout &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;int&gt;(VALUE);    // show the numeric value
</pre>
<p>
<li> When converting related pointers to each other.<br>
<p>
The <code>static_cast</code> is used in the context of class inheritance
(cf. chapter <a href="cplusplus13.html#INHERITANCE">13</a>) to convert a pointer to a so-called `derived
class' to a pointer to its `base class'. It cannot be used for casting
unrelated types to each other (e.g., a <code>static_cast</code> can<em>not</em> be used to
cast a pointer to a <code>short</code> to a pointer to an <code>int</code>).
<p>
A <code>void *</code> is a <em>generic pointer</em>. It is frequently used by
functions in the <strong>C</strong> library (e.g., <strong>memcpy</strong>(3)). Since it is the generic
pointer it is related to any other pointer, and a <code>static_cast</code> should be
used to convert a <code>void *</code> to an intended destination pointer. This is a
somewhat awkward left-over from <strong>C</strong>, which should probably only be used in
that context. Here is an example:
<p>
The <code>qsort</code> functions from the <strong>C</strong> library expects a pointer to a
(comparison) function having two <code>void const *</code> parameters. In fact, these
parameters point to data elements of the array to be sorted, and so the
comparison function must cast the <code>void const *</code> parameters to pointers to
the elements of the array to be sorted. So, if the array is an <code>int array[]</code>
and the compare function's parameters are <code>void const *p1</code> and <code>void const
*p2</code> then the compare function obtains the address of the <code>int</code> pointed
to by <code>p1</code> by using:
    <pre>
static_cast&lt;int const *&gt;(p1);
</pre>
<p>
<li> When undoing or introducing the signed-modifier of an <code>int</code>-typed
variable (remember that a <code>static_cast</code> is allowed to change the
expression's representation!). <br>
<p>
Here is an example: the <strong>C</strong> function <code>tolower</code> requires an <code>int</code>
representing the value of an <code>unsigned char</code>. But <code>char</code> by default is a
signed type. To call <code>tolower</code> using an available <code>char ch</code> we should use:
        <pre>
        tolower(static_cast&lt;unsigned char&gt;(ch))
</pre>
    </ul>
<p>
<a name="l52"></a>
<h3>3.5.2: The `const_cast'-operator</h3>
    The <code>const</code> keyword has been given a special place in casting. Normally
anything <code>const</code> is <code>const</code> for a good reason. Nonetheless situations
may be encountered where the <code>const</code> can be ignored. For these special
situations the <code>const_cast</code> should be used. Its syntax is:
                     <pre>
        const_cast&lt;type&gt;(expression)
</pre>
 A <a name="an243"></a><code>const_cast&lt;type&gt;(expression)</code> expression is used to undo the
<code>const</code> attribute of a (pointer) type.
<p>
The need for a <code>const_cast</code> may occur in combination with functions from
the standard <strong>C</strong> library which traditionally weren't always as const-aware
as they should. A function <code>strfun(char *s)</code> might be available, performing
some operation on its <code>char *s</code> parameter without actually modifying the
characters pointed to by <code>s</code>. Passing <code>char const hello[] = "hello";</code> to
<code>strfun</code> produces the warning
   <pre>
        passing `const char *' as argument 1 of `fun(char *)' discards const
</pre>
 A <code>const_cast</code> is the appropriate way to prevent the warning:
                 <pre>
        strfun(const_cast&lt;char *&gt;(hello));
</pre>
<p>
<a name="l53"></a>
<h3>3.5.3: The `reinterpret_cast'-operator</h3>
    The third new-style cast is used to change the <em>interpretation</em> of
information: the <code>reinterpret_cast</code>. It is somewhat reminiscent of the
<code>static_cast</code>, but <code>reinterpret_cast</code> should only be used when it is
<em>known</em> that the information as defined in fact is or can be interpreted as
something completely different. Its syntax is:
        <pre>
        reinterpret_cast&lt;pointer type&gt;(pointer expression)
</pre>
<p>
Think of the <code>reinterpret_cast</code> as a cast offering a poor-man's union:
the same memory location may be interpreted in completely different ways.
<p>
The <code>reinterpret_cast</code> is used, for example, in combination with the
<code>write</code> function that is available for <em>streams</em>. In <strong>C++</strong> streams are
the preferred interface to, e.g., disk-files. The standard streams like
<code>std::cin</code> and <code>std::cout</code> also are stream objects.
<p>
Streams intended for writing (`output streams' like <code>cout</code>) offer <code>write</code>
members having the prototype
        <pre>
        write(char const *buffer, int length)
</pre>
 To write the value stored within a <code>double</code> variable to a stream in its
un-interpreted binary form the stream's <code>write</code> member is used. However, as
a <code>double *</code> and a <code>char *</code> point to variables using different and
unrelated representations, a <code>static_cast</code> cannot be used. In this case a
<code>reinterpret_cast</code> is required. To write the raw bytes of a variable
<code>double value</code> to <code>cout</code> we use:
        <pre>
    cout.write(reinterpret_cast&lt;char const *&gt;(&amp;value), sizeof(double));
</pre>
<p>
All casts are potentially dangerous, but the <code>reinterpret_cast</code> is the
most dangerous of them all. Effectively we tell the compiler: back off, we
know what we're doing, so stop fuzzing. All bets are off, and we'd better
<em>do</em> know what we're doing in situations like these. As a case in point
consider the following code:
        <pre>
    int value = 0x12345678;     // assume a 32-bits int

    cout &lt;&lt; "Value's first byte has value: " &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt;
            static_cast&lt;int&gt;(
                *reinterpret_cast&lt;unsigned char *&gt;(&amp;value)
                            );
</pre>
    The above code produces different results on little and big endian
computers. Little endian computers show the value 78, big endian
computers the value 12. Also note that the different representations used by
little and big endian computers renders the previous example
(<code>cout.write(...)</code>) non-portable over computers of different architectures.
<p>
As a <a name="an244"></a>rule of thumb: if circumstances arise in which casts <em>have</em> to be
used, clearly document the reasons for their use in your code, making double
sure that the cast does not eventually cause a program to misbehave. Also:
avoid <code>reinterpret_casts</code> unless you <em>have</em> to use them.
<p>
<a name="l54"></a>
<h3>3.5.4: The `dynamic_cast'-operator</h3>
    Finally there is a new style cast that is used in combination with
polymorphism (see chapter <a href="cplusplus14.html#POLYMORPHISM">14</a>). Its syntax is:
                    <pre>
        dynamic_cast&lt;type&gt;(expression)
</pre>
 Different from the <code>static_cast</code>, whose actions are completely determined
<em>compile-time</em>, the <code>dynamic_cast</code>'s actions are determined <em>run-time</em> to
convert a pointer to an object of some class (e.g., <code>Base</code>) to a pointer to
an object of another class (e.g., <code>Derived</code>) which is found further down its
so-called <em>class hierarchy</em> (this is also called <em>downcasting</em>).
<p>
At this point in the <em>Annotations</em> a <code>dynamic_cast</code> cannot yet be
discussed extensively, but we return to this topic in section
<a href="cplusplus14.html#DYNAMICCAST">14.6.1</a>.
<p>
<a name="l55"></a>
<h3>3.5.5: Casting 'shared_ptr' objects</h3>
    In section <a href="cplusplus18.html#SHAREDPTR">18.4</a> we'll encounter the <a name="an245"></a><em>shared_ptr</em>, defined by
the C++11 standard.
<p>
To complete the overview of new-style casts, the casts to be used in
combination with <code>shared_ptr</code>s are mentioned below.
<p>
This section can safely be skipped without loss of continuity; actual coverage
of these specialized casts is postponed until section <a href="cplusplus18.html#SHAREDCAST">18.4.5</a>.
<p>
These specialized casts are:
    <ul>
    <li><code>static_pointer_cast</code>, returning a <code>shared_ptr</code> to the base-class
section of a derived class object;
    <li><code>const_pointer_cast</code>, returing a <code>shared_ptr</code> to a non-const object
from a <code>shared_ptr</code> to a constant object;
    <li><code>dynamic_pointer_cast</code>, returning a <code>shared_ptr</code> to a derived class
object from a <code>shared_ptr</code> to a base class object.
    </ul>
<p>

<h2>3.6: Keywords and reserved names in C++</h2>
<strong>C++</strong>'s  <a name="an246"></a>keywords are a superset of <strong>C</strong>'s  keywords. Here is a
list of all keywords of the language:
    
        <pre>
alignas  char32_t     enum     namespace        return        typedef

char     dynamic_cast long     reinterpret_cast true                   
char16_t else         mutable  requires         try                    
</pre>
<p>
Notes:
    <ul>
    <li> The <a name="an247"></a><code>export</code> keyword is removed from the language under the C++11
standard, but remains a keyword, reserved for future use.
    <li>  the <a name="an248"></a><em>operator keywords</em>: <code>and, and_eq, bitand, bitor, compl,
not, not_eq, or, or_eq, xor</code> and <code>xor_eq</code> are symbolic alternatives for,
respectively, <code>&amp;&amp;, &amp;=, &amp;, |, ~, !, !=, ||, |=, ^</code> and <code>^=</code>.
    <li> C++11 also recognizes the special identifiers <code>final</code> and
<code>override</code>. These identifiers are special in the sense that they acquire
special meanings when declaring classes or polymorphic functions. Section
<a href="cplusplus14.html#FINAL">14.4</a> provides further details.
    </ul>
<p>
Keywords can only be used for their intended purpose and cannot be used as
names for other entities (e.g., variables, functions, class-names, etc.). In
addition to keywords <a name="an249"></a>identifiers starting with an underscore and living in
the <a name="an250"></a><em>global namespace</em> (i.e., not using any explicit namespace or using the
mere <code>::</code> namespace specification) or living in the <em>std namespace</em> are
 <a name="an251"></a>reserved identifiers in the sense that their use is a prerogative of the
implementor.
